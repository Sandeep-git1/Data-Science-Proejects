Banking Data Analysis:
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (PBI1_Banking.ipynb) for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on banking customer data. The data is retrieved from a MySQL database, loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and analyzed using various statistical and visualization techniques.

Project Overview:
  The notebook demonstrates:
      -Connecting to a local MySQL database (bankingcase) and querying the customer table.
      -Basic data exploration: viewing data shape, info, summary statistics, and head/tail.
      -Univariate analysis: Binning numerical features (e.g., Estimated Income into Low/Med/High categories) and generating value counts.
      -Categorical feature analysis: Value counts and visualizations for columns like BRId, GenderId, Nationality, Occupation, Fee Structure, Loyalty Classification, Properties Owned, Risk Weighting, and more.
      -Visualizations: Bar plots and count plots (with hue for categorical comparisons, e.g., by GenderId).
The dataset includes customer details such as age, location, nationality, occupation, financial metrics (e.g., deposits, loans, credit card balances), and risk classifications.

Data Insights:
    -Dataset size: 3000 rows, 25 columns.
    -Key features: Age (17-85), Estimated Income (~16k-522k), Bank Deposits, Loans, Risk Weighting (1-5), etc.
    -Categorical distributions: E.g., Majority in "Jade" loyalty class; Europeans are the most common nationality.
