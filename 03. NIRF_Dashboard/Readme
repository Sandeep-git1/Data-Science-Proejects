NIRF Ranking Dashboard & Prediction

This project builds an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) rankings and predict future rankings (e.g., 2027).
- Features
      Web Scraping: Extracts NIRF ranking data from official site (HTML & PDFs).
      Data Cleaning: Structured dataset with attributes like TLR, RPC, GO, OI, Perception.
      Dashboard: Power BI visuals, institute comparisons, trends, and insights.
      Machine Learning: Predicts future rankings using models (Random Forest / XGBoost).
      Use Case: Institutes can benchmark performance and explore “whatif” scenarios.
- Workflow
      Scrape Dat → Python (BeautifulSoup, Camelot/Tabula).
      Transform Data → Power BI Power Query.
      Visualize → Interactive dashboard (trends, comparisons).
      Predict → ML model integrated with Power BI (Python script / Azure ML API).
- Tech Stack
      Python: Data scraping & ML.
      Power BI: Dashboard & analytics.
      Pandas, Scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup data + ML.
-Future Scope
      Extend to other categories (Overall, Universities, Management).
      Automate yearly updates from NIRF.
      Add ranking simulation based on attribute improvements.
